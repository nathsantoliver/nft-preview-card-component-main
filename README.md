## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that in the construction of a layout, as simple as it may seem, concepts can be merged so that the construction is better understood by other people who read the code.

### Continued development

I need to delve into box model concepts, know the best time to use flexbox or grid. Training in these concepts is important for my skills in building a layout to be done in a more fluid and harmonious way.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css) - This helped me to understand their concepts and application examples, making me understand if it is valid to apply that concept in the code or not.
- [CSS-Tricks Snippets](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/) - Like W3Schools, CSS trick helped me to understand concepts, mainly the applicability of flexbox and css grid, and the best way to style the page using these concepts.
